 
The essay presents a review on applications of machine learning methods in banking with a focus on the following problems: a) detecting credit card fraud; b) loan recommendation to clients; c) investment portfolio management. 

As a reader with some basic understanding in economics, I appreciate especially your introduction of the work by Frantar & Alistarh (2022) that employed sparse GPT to prune GPT class models.

Suggestions:

1) Perhaps author could relate the essay content with the various datasets on Kaggle; here's an example query:
https://www.kaggle.com/search?q=banking+date%3A730+in%3Adatasets

Note that the number 730 in the above URL approximates results from the past two years (365+365=730)
Questions that perhaps you could consider answering in your report:- Do any of these datasets seem more useful than the rest in terms of scalability (size) and generalizability (international vs local datasets)?

2) Regarding author's statement: "Supervised models perform better and seem to have higher recall and precision -- although overfitting is a challenge for supervised algorithms."

It's been noted on stackexchange.com, for instance, that overfitting is common even in unsupervised learning. As such, the author may wish to revise / expand this statement.

Reference: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/250212/is-overfitting-a-problem-in-unsupervised-learning#:~:text=Overfitting%20is%20of%20course%20a,not%20applicable%20in%20this%20setting.

3) Regarding author's statemetn "unsupervised approaches has been shown to yield significantly more accurate results in use cases such as network traffic classification (Erman et al, 2007)"
  
- Could you clarify this statement by answering this question: significantly more accurate to what? What is the reference being compared to in this statement? 

4) In the conclusion, it was mentioned that recommendation systems may risk adversarial attacks; could the author give some illustrative examples?

5)For instance, this dataset seems large but it is synthetic:Fraud detection payment system's dataset | Kaggle
Would you have thoughts on the utility of it?

6) A quick search shows the following datasets users could explore on recommendations:
